Hello All ! I am Rohit Vijay Bapat a Software Developer by profession. I am a Mechanical Engineer and like Maths. I love Computational Geometry (that's why I am still learning it!) and Development. I have created this library for STUDY purpose only!

I know there are other CAD libraries available online but, I come from a unique background with lots of experience in various fields such as CAD/CAM, CFD, FEA, Scientific Visualization and Virtual Reality/Gaming. Hence, I see a Computational Geometry library in different light.

I have a website [CGLibPy](https://cg.robasworld.com/) (Computational Geometry Library in Python) as dedicated website for this particular library. I hope it will always be a work in progress because, everyday I learn something new. I will try to keep it as updated as possible.

I have chosen Python as my primary language of development. Basic reason for that is the speed with which a code can be written in Python is way more than other languages, it is free to use, easy to deploy and can be scaled to be used in a web application (this will be a dream come true if I will be able to develop it. Of course it will take time and may be your help as well). Purposefully I am trying to avoid using any other libraries such as scipy or numpy etc. Not that I hate them it's just that I want to keep my library as original as possible.

I want to make this a Public library so that, if you find this library interesting and worth your time, you can also collaborate with me!

Looking forward for your help, collaboration and suggestions..
